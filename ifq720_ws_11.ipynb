An $R^2$ of $1$ means that the regression model explains all the variation in $y$, which is good in the sense that we can feel confident that our knowledge of $x$ is a perfect explanation of $y$.  In practice, values of $R^2$ close to $1$ (over $0.95$) typically indicate that \"over-fitting\" in the model which can lead to erroneous results using the model.  While we might think that small values of $R^2$ are \"bad\", an $R^2$ of $0.2$ could be quite good in some fields.  Interpreting the coefficient of determination is not as straightforward as other statistical measures. It should be used as a guide rather than conclusive evidence in making decisions about the validity or utility of a model.  "

In this case, we can use a technique called the analysis of covariance or ANCOVA to account for or control for these extraneous covariates. \n",
